            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Adam Fordsmand and this is my website. I am a developer whom have worked primarily in the financial auditing sector, where I've spent my time developing audit tools, amongst other things.<br>
                I was employed as a student assistant in KPMG, where my function was that of a software developer. I have in my function as a software developer, helped develop a large webapp in the python webserver Django, I have alse developed RPA(Robotics Process Automation) solutions, in Python, to automate processes in the company's daily workflow.<br>
                I was employed as a student assistant at EY for close to 4 years, were the last year of which, my primary function was that of a data worker, where I primarily transformed client data, but I also developed a couple of auditing tools outside of business season. Prior to my work as a data worker; I've for example gotten experience both in developing excel VBA macros, and I have worked with html through a sharepoint site. During my time as a data worker; I have worked on both Azure Cloud development in C# but also data transformation.<br>
                I take a large interest in computers and programming, and have been working on a few side projects in my spare time. In May 2020 I installed a minimal Linux distribution on my main desktop, and have been actively developing on my desktop environment since. I have also developed tools for my computer using shell-scripting and pipelines primarily, but has also developed a few in C.<br>
                I have a HTX-Gymnasiel degree, from VID Gymnasier, with the classes: Programming B, Math A, Technology C and Communications/IT A. The HTX focused primarily on video game development, and I has as such, during my studies, developed a handful of games primarily in unity.

                    <p>During my professional work:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C#</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="duo-list">
                    <p>During my spare time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>Lua</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                My favourite language to code in is C, however I am very well versed in the C-family of languages. I am still very young and have a lot to learn, when it comes to programming, but due to my professional experience despite my age, then I still have a level of competence.
